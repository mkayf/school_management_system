Suggested Workflow Jab Aap Bana Rahe Hon:
Step 1: Database Design
Migrations create karen for all tables

Relationships ko foreign keys ke zariye define karen

Step 2: Laravel Models & Relationships
Har model mein relations define karen (hasOne, belongsTo, belongsToMany, etc.)

Step 3: API Routes & Controllers
Resource controllers banayen (StudentsController, ClassroomsController, SubjectsController)

CRUD ke liye API endpoints banaen

Step 4: Seeders & Dummy Data
Kuch dummy data banayen for easy testing

Step 5: Frontend (Vue.js)
Pages banayen: Students List, Student Form, Classrooms List, Subjects List

Axios se API calls karen

Student form mein profile fields aur subject multi-select include karen

Tips for Smooth Development:
Eager Loading use karen jab students fetch kar rahe ho taake related data (profile, subjects, classroom) easily mil jaye

Vue mein forms ko modular banayen, jaise ek StudentForm.vue jo add/edit dono ke liye use ho

Validation Laravel aur Vue dono sides par karen

Laravel Resources (API Resources) use karen taake JSON clean mile
